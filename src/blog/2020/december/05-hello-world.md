# First Blog Entry

## Hello World!
Hello out there! This is my `Hello World!` for my new Blog.
I want to be more active in my online representation and well, what's the first thing that comes to mind?
Correct, let's blog.
I want to log my tech experiences as a Software Developer and use it to document knowledge for myself, but also
provide a knowledge base to everyone else out there.

## Upcoming
Today i learnt how to setup a Gatsby Project for example, which will probably be the next blog post.
If you want to setup a Gatsby Project yourself, stay tuned and you can learn what I learnt.
