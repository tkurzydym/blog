Again also install the Typescript types, because we like Typescript and use it.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shellsession\">  % npm install --save prismjs\n  % npm install --save babel-plugin-prismjs\n  % npm install --save babel-preset-gatsby\n  % npm install @types/prismjs\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Babel RC</h2>\n<p>Create a .babelrc file to configure the Syntax Highlighting for the Website.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"presets\": [\"babel-preset-gatsby\"],\n  \"plugins\": [\n    [\n      \"prismjs\",\n      {\n        \"languages\": [\n          // (1)\n          \"javascript\",\n          \"css\",\n          \"java\",\n          \"typescript\",\n          \"go\",\n          \"shellsession\",\n          \"json\",\n          \"graphql\"\n        ],\n        \"plugins\": [\"show-language\"],\n        \"theme\": \"tomorrow\", // (2)\n        \"css\": true\n      }\n    ],\n    [\"babel-plugin-styled-components\"]\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>All the Languages that you want to be supported by the Syntax Highlighting</li>\n<li>The theme that should be applied to the Source Code</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can see the Syntax Highlighting for JSON with the code for the .babelrc above.\nYou already saw a GraphQL Example on my last post if you have read it.</p>\n<p>Here is a Java Example:</p>\n<p>GiantPanda.java</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">public class GiantPanda extends Ursidae {\n  public GiantPanda(final String name)\n  {\n    super(name);\n    super.setConservationStatus(ConservationStatus.ENDANGERED);\n    super.setBinomialName(\"Ailuropoda melanoleuca\");\n    super.setCharacteristics(\"large, black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body\");\n  }\n\n  public String greet() {\n    return \"The Great Panda \" + super.getName() + \" sits down and waves back at you while smiling!\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>ConversationalStatus.java</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">enum ConservationStatus {\n  EXTINCT, ENDANGERED, THREATENED, DELISTED\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>For further reference on all the themes and configuration possibilities see <a href=\"https://prismjs.com\">PrismJS</a>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The usage of PrismJS with Babel was a super easy way to include Syntax Highlighting to my blog.\nWhile it maybe isn't the cleanest solution in terms of performance or size, it is totally fine for my blog.\nI don't have big Source Code chunks in my posts and my Website isn't too big in size anyway.\nWith using markdown you get a pre-configured plugin which you just have to include though. That might be a way simpler\nway to include Syntax Highlighting if you don't insist on using asciidoctor.</p>\n<h2>Upcoming</h2>\n<p>On the next Blog Post I will talk about Dark Modes.</p>","frontmatter":{"category":"Gatsby","publishdate":"January 08, 2021","title":"PrismJS","slug":"blog/2021/january/08-prism-highlighting"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3ba1b3bd-0042-5fb6-864e-374dc5cc8cc4","frontmatter__slug":"blog/2021/january/08-prism-highlighting","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"blog"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1830463481","2907835096","3649515864","4093159304","63159454"]}
