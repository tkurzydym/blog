Slack chats, Discord, Blogs, Articles, oh - Pull Requests!</p>\n<p>For gods sake, I hope you don't have to review those mile long pull requests\nvery often. But even small pull requests are way easier to read. And if one of\nyour colleagues is pushing out that nightmare of a long pull request and you\ndon't feel like declining it immediately, it is way easier to read on a vertical\nscreen - at least from my point of view.</p>\n<p>I actually rarely code on that screen, but if I do it is most often\nYAML code. Any infrastructure code, configurations or OpenAPI definitions in\nYAML for example. Using swagger-ui benefits from a screen in portrait as well,\nbecause of the nature of that page and how the documentation is structured.</p>\n<h2>Cons of having a Vertical Monitor</h2>\n<p>Regarding some cons. Well obviously, you lose some horizontal space for applications\nin comparison to your normal secondary widescreen monitor. For me the gained vertical\nspace is a compromise I can easily live with.</p>\n<p>One experience I made is that you need to be able to place the bottom of the screen\nmore or less directly on the table, otherwise you have to look up really high.\nBefore I had my monitor sitting right on the desk, the height of the monitor\ncaused me some neck pain from looking up quite often to the upper edge of the screen.</p>\n<p>Next up: Sometimes, text at the very top or bottom of the screen is a bit hard\nto read or focus on for longer times e.g. if you're not able to scroll for instance.\nThis is why I also like to use the upper and lower part of the screen only for\nsome status updates or state change notifications.\nWindow managers can help to organize the windows on the screen in a way, that\nyou can split up your onscreen space in three parts very fast.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>I like it and it seems like I will not change back very soon.</p>\n<p>Let me know if you have any experience with this and if you\nhave cool tips or tools that help with having a monitor in portrait mode.\nI would love to hear them!</p>","frontmatter":{"category":"Desk setup","publishdate":"September 24, 2022","title":"Using a secondary monitor in portrait mode","slug":"blog/2022/september/24-vertical-monitor"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c0f6a2b0-7181-5a5b-a1bb-12412d27a03d","frontmatter__slug":"blog/2022/september/24-vertical-monitor","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"blog"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1830463481","2907835096","3649515864","4093159304","63159454"]}
